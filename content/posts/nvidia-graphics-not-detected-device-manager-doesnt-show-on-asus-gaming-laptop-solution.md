I had asus a17 ryzen 7 rtx3050 unfortunately after a while nvidia control panel was showing no graphics detected !

solution:

open asus "Armoury Crate software"

goto system> profile and change eco mode to standard mode or any other performance mode

now reintall nvidia graphics driver and check device manager . All should be working fine!

damn asus
